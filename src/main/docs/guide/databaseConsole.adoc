Additional setup to view the H2 Database Console.  Add the following to application.yml
spring:
  h2:
    console:
      enabled: true

If you run the app again, you should see the same page as before. However, you can login to the H2 Console and view your new database table.

Browse to `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` and login. The default username is `sa`, without a password. The default JDBC URL is: `jdbc:h2:mem:devDb;MVCC=TRUE;LOCK_TIMEOUT=10000;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE`

NOTE: You can view the JDBC url in `application.yml`, under `environments` `development` `dataSource` `url`

Once you've logged in to the DB Console, you should see your new `VEHICLES` table in the left-hand sidebar. Click the `+` icon to expand the table - you should see a list of columns, including the three `String` fields we just defined, `name`, `make,` and `model`.
