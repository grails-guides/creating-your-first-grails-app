Let's take a look at one more common GSP tag: `<g:link>`

[source,xml]
.grails-app/views/home/index.gsp
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/views/home/index.gsp[indent=0,lines="33..35"]
----

`<g:link>` renders an HTML `<a>` tag, but it has the advantage in that it allows you to specify your link target following Grails conventions, such as this example (using the `controller`, `action` and `id` attributes). `<g:link>` is also smart enough to follow our URL mappings, so if we change the URL mapping for `vehicle/show`, the `<g:link>` tag will still render the correct URL. There's many more attributes supported by `<g:link>` - see the http://docs.grails.org/latest/ref/Tags/link.html[Grails documentation] for more.
