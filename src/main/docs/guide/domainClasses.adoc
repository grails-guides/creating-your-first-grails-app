Grails is an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller[Model View Controller] (MVC) framework, based upon the Spring Boot project. Typically an MVC application divides the responsibilities of the app into three categories:

1. Model - code that defines and manages the data
2. View - code that manages the presentation of data (e.g, HTML page)
3. Controller - code that defines the business logic of the application, and manages the transfer of data between the model and the view

Typically an object-oriented MVC framework requires the developer to configure which classes correspond to each of the three categories above. However, Grails goes farther than most frameworks by following a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration["Convention over Configuration"] approach to development. This means that for many artefact types in Grails (controllers, views, etc), you simply create a file in a particular directory in your project, and Grails will automatically wire it into your application without any additional configuration on your part.

TIP: Handling the mapping of domain classes to database tables (and other persistent stores) is the job of http://gorm.grails.org/latest/[GORM], the Grails Object Relational Mapper. GORM is a powerful tool in the Grails framework, and can even be used standalone outside of a Grails project. It supports relational databases (via Hibernate) as well as MongoDb, Neo4j, Redis and Cassandra datasources. Please see the http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html[GORM documentation] for more information.

When building a MVC application, it is typical to start with the "M" (Model), also known as the "Domain model". In Grails, your domain model is defined with Groovy classes under `grails-app/domain`. Let's create a domain class.
