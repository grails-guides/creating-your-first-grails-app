== Installing Grails

=== SDKMan

http://sdkman.io['sdkman'] is a popular command line utility for installing and managing Grails installations (as well as other JVM frameworks and languages). Install `sdkman` by running the following command in your Unix terminal:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
----

Once the installation is complete, install the latest version of Grails (this guide uses 3.2.4):

[source, bash]
----
$ sdk install grails 3.2.4
----

`sdkman` will prompt you to choose whether to set this version as the default (choose 'yes').

[source, bash]
----
$ grails --version

| Grails Version: 3.2.4
| Groovy Version: 2.4.7
| JVM Version: 1.8.0_77
----

NOTE: If you are running Windows, there is a clone project of `sdkman` available that follows the same conventions. You can download it from https://github.com/flofreud/posh-gvm[https://github.com/flofreud/posh-gvm]


=== Download from Grails.org

This is not the recommend way to install Grails, but here are the manual installation steps, if the above methods fails.

Download the Grails binary package from https://grails.org/download.html[https://grails.org]. Unpack the package in a convenient directory.

[source, bash]
----
$ unzip ~/Downloads/grails-3.2.4.zip
----

Edit your `.bashrc` (most Linux flavors) or `.bash_profile` file with the following environment variables (add these to the end of the file)

Set the `GRAILS_HOME` environment variable to the location where you extracted the zip

[source, bash]
----
export GRAILS_HOME=/path/to/grails-3.2.4
----

On Windows you can create an environment variable under `My Computer/Advanced/Environment Variables`

Now add the Grails `bin` directory to your `PATH` variable:

[source, bash]
----
export GRAILS_HOME=/path/to/grails-3.2.4
export PATH="$PATH:$GRAILS_HOME/bin
----

Again, on Windows you will need to modify the `Path` environment variable under `My Computer/Advanced/Environment Variables`

You should now be able to type grails -version in the terminal window and verify that Grails has been installed successfully:

[source, bash]
----
$ grails --version

| Grails Version: 3.2.4
| Groovy Version: 2.4.7
| JVM Version: 1.8.0_77
----
