Let's modify our `HomeController` to render some custom content on our home page. Edit `grails-app/controllers/org/grails/guides/HomeController.groovy`.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/org/grails/guides/HomeController.groovy
----
package org.grails.guides

class HomeController {

    def index() {
        respond([name: session.name ?: 'User', vehicleTotal: Vehicle.count()]) //<1>
    }

    def updateName(String name) {
        session.name = name //<2>

        flash.message = "Name has been updated" //<3>

        redirect action: 'index' //<4>
    }

}
----
<1> We're calling the `respond` method to render a Groovy map of content to the requestor, containing a `name` property from the session (defaulting to "User" if no session value exists) and the current total of `Vehicle` instances from GORM's `count` method.
<2> `session` is an instance of the Servlet APIâ€™s`HttpSession` class, and is available in every controller. We can retrieve and store properties in the session - in this case, we're storing a `String` with the attribute `name` in the session. For more see the https://docs.grails.org/latest/ref/Controllers/session.html[Grails documentation].
<3> We're using `flash` scope to set a message to display upon the next request
<4> We don't have any specific content to display in this action, so we issue a redirect back to the `index` action (note that in Groovy method parenthesis are optional so long as there is at least one argument).

We've updated our `index`  action to render some custom content to the page, and we've created a new action `updateName`, which takes a `String` parameter and saves it to the `session` for later retrieval. However, we need to update our view to 1. display the newly available content, and 2. provide some means of calling `updateName` and setting the `session` attribute.

Edit `grails-app/views/home/index.gsp`:

[source, xml]
.grails-app/views/home/index.gsp
----
<html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="layout" content="main"/>
    <title>Home Page</title>
</head>
<body>

<div id="content" role="main">
    <section class="row colset-2-its">
        <h1>Welcome ${name}!</h1> //<1>

        <h4>${flash.message}</h4>  //<2>

        <p>There are ${vehicleTotal} vehicles in the database.</p> //<1>

        <form action="/home/updateName" method="post" style="margin: 0 auto; width:320px"> //<3>
            <input type="text" name="name" value="" id="name">
            <input type="submit" name="Update name" value="Update name" id="Update name">
        </form>

    </section>
</div>

</body>
</html>
----
<1> We can refer to any values in our "model" by name in a GSP page, using Groovy String Expressions `${name}` `${vehicleTotal}`
<2> Here we're accessing our `flash.message` property - if it's null then nothing will render here.
<3> This is a plain HTML form that will submit the `name` text field to the `updateName` action we just created.

Run the app and you should see our new message in the `<h1>` header: "Welcome User!", as well as the current total of `Vehicle` instances in the database.

Try entering your own name in the form and submitting it - you should see the page reload and your own name will replace "User". Refresh the page a few times. Because we stored the `name` in the session, it will persist as long as the session is valid.

== Content Negotiation

Remember we used the `respond` method, instead of the simpler `render` method to send our "model" to the page. This means we can get our model using other formats besides an HTML page, such as JSON or XML.


Run the following command in a terminal (while the app is running)
[source, bash]
----
$ curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" "http://localhost:8080/home/index"

HTTP/1.1 200
X-Application-Context: application:development
Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=008B45AAA1A820CE5C9FDC2741D345F3;path=/;HttpOnly
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Wed, 11 Jan 2017 04:06:57 GMT

{"name":"User","vehicleTotal":3}
----

We've used `curl` to call our `index` action, but we've changed our `Accept` header to `application/json`. Now instead of an HTML page, we receive the same data in JSON.

You can request different content types in the browser as well, thanks to Grails' default URL Mappings (shown below):

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/org/grails/guides/UrlMappings.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/org/grails/guides/UrlMappings.groovy[lines="6..10"]
----

Note the `(.$format)?` token in the mapping. This will match a suffix on our URL such as `.json` or `.xml`. Test this out in your browser.

Browse to `http://localhost:8080/home/index.json`. You should see the same JSON body we retrieved using `curl`.

Try changing `.json` to `.xml`. You should see an XML representation of the model. Content negotiation allows your controllers to be very versatile and to return appropriate data to different clients from the same actions.
